# First-Portfolio-Project 

## Overview
In this project, I will be doing an exploratory analysis of the TelCo Customer Churn dataset. The goal of this project is to both discover which customers are most likely to churn each year, and to model how best to retain them.


## Dataset Description
The dataset we're using as mentioned above is the "TelCo Customer Churn" dataset which can be most easily found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). 

This data contains 21 columns of data, with each row corresponding to one customer with a unique Customer ID. The variables associated with each customer range from gender, length the customer has been with the company, to the type of internet service the customer uses.

Our target variable is of course the "Churn" variable, which is binary yes/no data, on whether or not the customer churned.
